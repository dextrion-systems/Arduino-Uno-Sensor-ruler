This is how I made a ruler with an arduino uno, a LCD display and an ultrasonic sensor.
Parts I used :
	
	
	
	
	. Arduino UNO R3
	. HC-SR04 ultra sonic sensor 
	. A 2 x 16 lcd display 
	. Jumper wires
	. Power
	. Computer with Arduino IDE

Pins:
		
		Sensor 
		VCC == 5v
		GND == GND
		ECHO == D8
		TRIGG == D9
		
		Display
		VCC == 5v (Or what your display is rated for)
		GND == GND
		SDA == A4
		SCL == A5
